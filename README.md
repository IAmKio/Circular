CSS Checkbox
========

Does what it says on the tin. A Javascript library that converts checkboxes to stylable elements using CSS, whilst preserving the original checkbox and state.

Quick Start
----------------
For the TL:DR demon in you...

Simply:

	bower install css-checkbox
	
Then copy or reference the `css-checkbox.js` **and** `css-checkbox.css` in your HTML from the `dist` directory. **You need to use both files**.
